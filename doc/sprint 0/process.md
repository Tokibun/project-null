### How did you organize the team?  Which tools did you use, if any?

Discord for online voice calls during team meeting, planning poker, mockup discussion, and stack discussion.

Balsamiq was used for prototyping and mockup.

Notepad was used for text editing.

### How did you make decisions?

We made decisions with a democratic process. If there were similar ideas, we had a discussion about the viewpoints for the various ideas.

### How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?  How many rounds of voting (on average)did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate

Priority was defined using planning poker. We used a Fibonacci scale. We ordered the stories in order of importance and furthermore, used planning poker to decide upon the difficulty of each story. We needed to come to a consensus for each point estimate. We did this by discussing if a team member suggested a higher/lower score in order to understand all of the possible interpretations of the story.

### Did you meet in person or online?

We met mostly during an online video call while sometimes meeting after tutorials in-person. Some members in the group met in person and would call those members not on campus.

### How frequently did you meet?

2-3 times a week. 2 meetings were regular voice calls and some meeting were held after tutorials in-person.

### What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

Team members should be more cordial for meeting times. Decided meeting times should be understood as "Be ready to meet call at that time". Team members should only change meeting times when all team members agree to the changed meeting time.
