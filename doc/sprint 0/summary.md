## Project objectives:

To create a social networking platform by fans, and for fans, where fans, vendors, and cosplayers alike can connect with each other through posts, chats, and events. Through a custom experience system where users tag their own level of expertise in a fandom, we are able to tailor their experiences like no other social media platform.


## Key personas:

Omar is a vendor. He is a fan of old cartoons. He collects rare figures and other merchandise and then sells them to other fans. Omar attends events and conventions to sell to other fans. He uses social media to advertise his vending and get information about upcoming events.

John is a more casual fan, he spends all his time travelling and spends his free time playing video games like Minecraft. Minecraft is a small hobby for him and he also wants to learn more about it as a casual fan, so he goes on social media sometimes to read posts of his favourite content creators.

Jessica is a very involved cosplayer. Her use of social media revolves around her experience as a cosplayer. She uses social media to collaborate with other fans in order to build costumes while contributing to discussions about her favorite shows. She also likes to use social media to meet up with other fans in order to take cosplay pictures for events in groups.


## Scenarios

Omar wants to advertise his wares using posts on Fanlinc. To get fans interested, he posts pictures of his collection. 

Omar uses the Fanlinc events to let his customers know where he is going to be on the convention grounds, which event he is going to, the dates and times, etc.

John likes to read posts on Fanlinc. He wants to search up some more information about pigs in Minecraft. John finds that he can kill pigs in Minecraft to get porkchops to satisfy his hunger. 

John wants to look up the profiles of experienced Minecraft players in order to get information about the game. John intends to look at their posts and learn about more advanced strategies so that he can optimize his gameplay experience.

Jessica uses the Fanlinc chat feature in order to communicate with other cosplayers to gather suggestions for future costume changes and potential ideas.

Jessica filters through posts by cosplayer-type fan in order to more easily find content tailored to her interests as a fan.


## Principles

We strive to specialize our social media platform to meet the unique needs of fans, whatever the fandom, and whatever the type of fan.

We want to maximize the ease of use for our users. We want our platform to adapt to meet their experience level in fandoms so they always engaged.

We want to connect fans to each other. The name of our app is FanLINC, so we want to link fans together to create a sense of community within the fandom.
