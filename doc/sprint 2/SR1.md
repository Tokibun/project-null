# SPRINT RETRO AND PRODUCT OWNER MEETING

### October 24th

- Participants: All Team + Kazam (Fanlinc Product Owner) + TA
- Project demo with TA was satisfactory. 
- Reviewed previous sprint backlog as a group and moved any uncompleted user stories from sprint 1 to sprint 2.
- Discussed how the previous sprint went. 
  - Good:
    - Completed at least 3 user stories.
    - By the end of the sprint, user stories were able to be worked on in parallel.
  - Bad:
    - Project started off as a bottleneck with only a one person being able to work on it at once
    - Not everyone knew what everyone else was doing in the sprint.
    - Quite a few of the user stories were left uncompleted.
    - Underestimated amount of time needed for front-end configuration.
- Plans for this sprint
  - Ensure the everyone in the group is informed on what is being worked on by who, when its done and any issues or setbacks they may be facing. This is done by having more communication via Discord.
  - Complete all previous sprint user stories
  - Not take on too much of a workload as majority of the user stories can be broken down into a front-end component and a back-end component. As both are required for Criteria of Satisfaction to be met.
