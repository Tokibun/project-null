Sprint 2 changes are made in the system-design.pdf

That is the **PDF** file.

Changes are in the form of PDF annotations, I had trouble with my Windows machine while working on this. So this is my band-aid solution.

Changes on pages 5, 8 as annotations to reflect new knowledge gained throughout this sprint.



**Note:** Some PDF viewers on windows do not like annotations made by Okular (pdf viewer). So, use a Linux computer. BV Labs, IC, VM etc.
