## Sprint 2 Goal

### October 24 (During Tutorial)

Participants: All Team + Kazam (Fanlinc Product Owner) + TA



The goal of this sprint is the following:

- Complete all previous sprint user stories (we were too ambitious for sprint 1, NULL-14)
- Implement basic fandom features (NULL-2, NULL-11, NULL-12, NULL-13, NULL-23), also improve UI for existing components (NULL-49)
- Account/Sessions (NULL-4)
- Not take on too much workload as the majority of the user stories are broken down into a front-end and back-end tasks per the criteria of sanctification to be met
