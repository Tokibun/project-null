# Sprint Retrospective

### Participants: 

All team members during Thursday Tutorial (10am-11am).

### What went well in the Sprint:

Did well given the circumstances of midterms, projects and other coursework.

3 features completed and everything was started and is more than half done if not done.



### What could be improved:

Didn't fully complete everything, the bottleneck is the UI side of the project, the backend part of our tasks are completed but our CoS requires a front end part too which is the bottleneck for the team.



### What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint:

Improve the team's time management. There should be someone working at something all the time.

Team communication, for example, some people did not understand how the account login/logout worked and how it fits into the larger picture. So, improve communication since there's times where people are stuck on something because they need to ask person X.

Time management should be better as midterms are over now (minus C01).

Look into redefining our CoS to split the front and back end parts of our tasks.

Remembering to update Jira as we complete things.
