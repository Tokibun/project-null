# Sprint Planning Meeting

This meeting occured during the Thursday tutorial and into the hour after.

Participants: All

The goal of this sprint is the following:

- Complete all previous user stories from previous sprint.

- Increase the overall code quality on the backend.
- Take on a managable workload.
- Change some CoS to be less demanding.



Events and posts will not happen in this sprint due to the need to take on a managable workload. Nearing the end of the semester is when everything gets piled on, in realistic terms, it's not wise to try to do events/posts.

This sprint will focus on implementing everything else. The things implemented will basically tie everything together, things such as "Login lead to Profile page" which will tie the login part and the front end stuff, "schema/resolver refactoring" which will use the account sessions stuff made in the previous sprint to have reflexive api calls such as currentAccount which will get the current account based on the caller's session. This is the sprint that will tie everything together since everything from the previous sprint is nearly done.

There are user stories to increase the code quality, through refactoring, testing, etc.

Some user stories need their CoS changed since that CoS basically turns a trivial user story into something larger than it needs to be. So when that happens, it should be broken up into two (or more) user stories. Consider this the "S" of INVEST.
