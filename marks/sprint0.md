## summary.md

**total mark**: 8/8

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|project objectives have been specified clearly|2|2|
|key users have been identified clearly|2|2|
|scenarios have been described clearly|2|2|
|principles have been describled clearly|2|2|

**additional comments**:

- some good scenarios; some others you can consider
    - people interested in certain fandoms wanting to just discuss fandoms with other fans
    - people who make fan-art related to fandoms who want to share their art with other people who enjoy the fandom
- principles are a little general (could apply to any social media platform) but are acceptable

## competition.md

**total mark**: 1/2

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|competition has been identified clearly|1|2|

**additional comments**:

- a lot of focus on reddit
    - is a good example but there are more examples than just subreddits on reddit
- some of the lacking qualities of competitors feel shoehorned or don't seem relevant
    - examples:
        - _Facebook puts a large focus on the individual_
            - this is true but this is a separate and non-relevant feature of Facebook; you should be more concerned contrasting and comparing with the groups feature
        - _Discord is focused group chatting and discussions_
            - this is not really an issue with Discord; it would be good to see Fanlinc also provide these features

**additional comments**:

- team roles are not very clear
    - who is doing what? who is reponsible for what? how do you decide each team member's roles?
- decision making is not very clear
    - _We made decisions using a democratic process..._
        - what democratic process did you use? did you vote? what things did you vote on?
- want some more detail in what you're doing in your meetings
    - when you are meeting with one another is the least important part of your meetings
        - what are you talking about during meetings? who needs to be there? how do you make sure the meetings are productive? who leads the meetings?
