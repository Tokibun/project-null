## planning meetings

**total mark**: 5/5

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|RPM.md is well documented|3|3|
|sprint1.md is well documented|2|2|

**additional comments**:

- generally well documented
- sprint 1 was a little ridiculous (in terms of story points; you assigned the greatest number of points to this sprint)
    - try and be a little more realistic in the later sprints so you don't have to scramble for each sprint

**additional comments**:

- user stories have the same issues from sprint 0
    - no reference to specific personas; no benefit
        - i.e. user story has "goal" but no "benefit"
        - e.g. as a user (i want to create an account -- "goal") (so that i can access fanlinc -- "benefit")
- not seeing any estimated story point values
