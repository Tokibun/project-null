## general comments

- this team seems to have an issue with taking on too much work
    - take into account the work you have in other courses and plan adequately for it
        - don't become too overambitious; focus on making tasks that you know you can complete and do things within your skill levels

## planning meetings

**total mark**: 4/5

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|`SR1.md` is well documented|2|2|
|`sprint2.md` is well documented|2|3|

**additional comments**:

- `SR1.md`:
    - it's not really clear who participated and who contributed what to the dicsussion but didn't deduct any marks
        - although you stated at the top that everyone participated, try and specifically note instances where specific team members contributed
            - e.g. in the plans or good/bad practices, label suggestions made by specific team members
    - although not explicitly stated, try to think about how to counteract the "bad" practices made in the previous sprint
        - this will help you improve for the next sprint
- `sprint2.md`:
    - a lot of things are kind of vague and could use more elaboration
        - e.g. "implement basic fandom features"
            - list specific features when possible; what is considered a "basic" fandom feature
        - e.g. how are you going to accomplish some of the goals you set out to accomplish this sprint?
            - what are you going to do to accomplish these tasks?
            - for the shortcomings from the previous sprint, how are you going to make sure they don't happen again?

## tracking on jira

**total mark**: 17/20

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|all stories present on `sprint2.md` are recorded on JIRA|2|2|
|did you start all stories for sprint two|1|2|

|is the commit done by the person to whom the task has been assigned|2|2|
|task distribution is even|2|2|
|continuous work is being done|5|5|
|daily standup|2|5|

**additional comments**:

- some stories appear to have been carried over from all the way from sprint 1
    - e.g. NULL-12 and NULL-13
        - really discuss what amount of work is realistic for your group to be able to complete; this has become an ongoing issue
- the majority of your GitHub commits are matching up with the actual ticket number on JIRA but not all of them
    - make sure that any commit that is tied to a JIRA task is prefixed with the ticket number
- standups are mostly being done daily but not everyone is contributing to them
    - especially early standups only really have one person contributing to them
        - even if you have no updates, state in the standup document that you have no updates to make
